                Raax festival is celebrated in Nalbari with much pomp and grandeur during November. Not only has the festival become a&nbsp; part and parcel of Nalbari, it has got intertwined with its socio cultural life. In fact, this celebration is associated with the Raax Leela of Lord Krishna with his &#39;Gopis&#39;. It is said that the bewitching autumn moon accompanied by gentle breeze wafting through made Lord Krishna pick up his flute. The captivating music that deftly flowed from his flute made the &#39;Gopis&#39; leave their household chores and join Him in &#39;Raax Leela&#39;. This festival finds mention in ancient scriptural like Shri Bhagawad Puran, Vishnu Puran and later on in Srimanta Sankarceva&rsquo;s&nbsp; at Adi Dasam, Kirtan and plays like Keligopal. Raax signifies the ultimate devotion and love of the gopis towards Lord Krishna who to them is the epitome of Love on spiritual parameter. It is the celebration of total surrender to the Lord, oblivious of the world around and of his varied roles. In Nalbari Raax festival is celebrated in the premises of Hari Mandir in the heart of the town. The festival has a big mela, along with local mobile theater performing, giving a festive atmosphere throughout the town with people even from other parts of the state flocking to see it. Comparable to the Ganpati festival of Mumbai, Dussehera of Mysore, this Raax festival is the unifying thread of otherwise heterogeneous society as people forget the barriers of caste and creed, and get immersed in the spirit of the festival.<br />
