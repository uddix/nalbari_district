                According to history, this pond/tank has been built by one of the members of the Ahom Dynasty. This pond was built after sacrificing a buffalo at the spot and is thus considered sacred owing to some age old prejudices. The sacrifice rites and rituals were performed to achieve upliftment from the curse of water scarcity in the region. Hence, the pond received the name “Mahmara Pukhuri”.
