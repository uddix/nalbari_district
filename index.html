        <center><h2>Nalbari District<hr></h2></center>
        <p>Located at the base of the eastern Himalayas in Assam, Nalbari is a perfect getaway to explore the wilderness of nature with its vast Paddy 
            fields and dense forests. With Indo-Bhutan border marking the north boundary of the district while Brahmaputra River lying on its south, 
            Nalbari is a place of experiencing culture and nature together.</p> 
            
        <p>This place is also a land of worship, spirituality and many ancient temples attracting tourists not only from India but from across the globe to seek blessings. 
            Also famous for its folk dances and music, 
            Raas is a major festival in the area celebrated in the month of November in Hari Temple and is worth attending.</p>
        <p>The tributaries of the Brahmaputra, Nona, Buradia, Pagaldia, Borolia and Tihu which are originated from the foothills of the Himalayan Range are 
            wild in nature and have enormous contribution towards the agrarian economy of the district. 
            The northern side of the district is bounded by the Indo-Bhutan International boundary and the southern side by the mighty Brahmaputra. 
            The Darrang and the Kamrup District are located in the east and the Barpeta District is in the west.This district is known in whole Assam 
            due to its excellent academic performance in 10th exam.
            Almost in every year this districts tops the list.
            This district has tremendous potential to transform into one of the major district of Assam but due to various unavoidable factors its not happening till now.
            This district has only 3 tea gardens which is really a very small figure when we compare with other districts of upper assam.<br />
        </p>
        <p>The District has a sub-tropical climate with semi - dry hot summer and cold winter. During summer, generally during the months from May to August, 
            heavy rainfall occurs for which the district experiences flood. The District experiences annual (average) rainfall and humidity @ 1500 mm and @ 80 % 
            respectively.
